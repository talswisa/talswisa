### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I'm Tal Swisa

I'm a M.Sc. computer science steudent in the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.
I am very passionate about machine learning in general and natural language processing in particular.

I have finished my B.Sc. in computer science at the technion as wel with honors, with a GPA of 91.9, and my current GPA in the M.Sc. is 92.5.


I have had some cool projects that I would like to show you:

### NLP Projects  ðŸ’¬
#### Thesis Research (2020-Now)
In my current research with Professor Shaul Markovich, we are working in the field of narratives understanding, which is essentailly understanding stories. We use knwoledge graphs such as Conceptnet and DBpedia in order to build schemes we call *Generalized Narratives* that capture common sense knowledge from the given set of narratives, and then use it in order to understand an new narrative.
We hope to achieve an improved ability to understand narratives, using a completely explainable system.

#### Improving Semantic Textual Similarity by Dividing Ambiguous Words Meanings (2020)
In this project we developed several algorithms for improving word embedding by resolving word sense disambiguation. Our algorithms recieve a corpus and outputs a labeled corpus, in which each occurence of a word w is assinged to a sense class of w (possibly, there is a single sense class for a word). Then, using the labeled corpus, an embedding algorithm learns an embedding for each word sense, instead of mixing all senses in a single embedding.
In order to evaluate our method, we tested sentence embeddings on a similarity dataset.
Check out the project report here: [Improving Semantic Textual Similarity by Dividing Ambiguous Words Meanings](https://github.com/talswisa/talswisa/blob/main/Improving%20Semantic%20Textual%20Embedding%20by%20Dividing%20Ambiguous%20Words%20Meanings.pdf)
